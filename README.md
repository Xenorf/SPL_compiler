# SPL Compiler

## Description
This compiler was created as part of the module Languages and their compilers in Hull University

## Requirements
This repository was created on Ubuntu-20.04 and the script are meant to be used on this environnement. It's still possible to run the compiler on Windows but it will take more work. The following requirements are for a linux user.

* Install Python 3 `apt-get install python3`
* Install Flex `apt-get install flex`
* Install Bison `apt-get install bison`
* Install GraphViz `apt-get install graphviz` (we will need it to generate the graphic representation of the parse tree)
* Authorize your user to execute **compile.sh** `chmod u+x compile.sh`
